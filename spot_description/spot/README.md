This 'spot' folder contains the same stuff in the 'spot' folder in the URDF.zip
file ([link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZnD4UxcuJSCufE-UVvJBFQtlVohIKtjo/view?usp=sharing)).
It contains meshes of the arm (among other things), under mesh/.

Note that if you look into the .dae files of the arm, you will notice that the
materials are all black. Not sure if this is intentional.

Note that we are ONLY using the arm meshes here. The other meshes are located
under spot_description/meshes.
